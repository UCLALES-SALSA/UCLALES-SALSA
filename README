UCLALES-SALSA is a Large-Eddy model coupled with a detailed sectional 
microphysics module for aerosol, clouds and precipitation.

To install this model, simply type 
   >> git clone https://github.com/UCLALES-SALSA/UCLALES-SALSA.git
and run 
   >> make seq
or
   >> make mpi
depending if you want a sequential build for single-processor runs
or an MPI build for parallel multiprocessor runs. Note that you
probably have to adjust the paths to MPI and NetCDF libraries in the
makefile found in the model root folder. Makefile_ubuntu and 
Makefile_CRAY provide examples for a simple ubuntu workstation and
a Cray supercomputing cluster. The code compiles correctly at least 
with GCC. Intel compilers should work, too.

After compiling the model, the executable is found in the bin-folder
together with the runscript "runles". This should be used for both
parallel and sequential runs. You probably need to adjust the generation
of the file job.sh at the end of the script according to the specifics 
of your local batch system. The bin folder contains all the necessary files
to perform a testrun.

Case specific runscripts and sound-in files used in publications
will be available in another repository at 
  https://github.com/UCLALES-SALSA/CONFIGURATION-FILES
For simple cases, just replace the runscript and sound-in files
in the bin-directory of the model with the case-specific ones. If 
anything more elaborate is necessary, this will be documented with 
the case-specific configuration files.
