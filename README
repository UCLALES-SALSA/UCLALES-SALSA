** Description
UCLALES-SALSA (University of California Los Angeles Large Eddy Simulation model–Sectional Aerosol module for Large Scale Applications) is a large-eddy model that employs a sectional representation of aerosol and hydrometeor microphysics to simulate the size-resolved condensation/deposition of water as well as hydrometeor aggregation rates between different aerosol and hydrometeor types.
Aerosol size-composition effects are accounted for using a microphysical scheme based on aerosol dry particle size and mixing state. Wet sizes are used to evaluate transitions from aerosol particles to cloud droplets, or from cloud droplets to rain droplets in the collision between droplets as described in Tonttila et al. (2017) and Tonttila et al. (2021).
Ice particles are represented as a single ice "free" category with time-evolving mass and particle projected area laws based on the concept of filling in with rime used in the predicted particle properties (P3) scheme of Morrison and Milbrandt (2015). Primary ice production pathway includes homogeneous ice nucleation, and heterogeneous ice nucleation through the immersion, deposition, and contact freezing mechanisms described in Tonttila et al. (2022). Secondary ice production pathways include the mechanisms of rime splintering, droplet shattering and ice-ice collisional breakup described in Calderón et al. (2025).
The UCLALES core is based on the modelling framework of Stevens et al. (2005) available from its repository (https://github.com/uclales/uclales/tree/master)
All modifications and components related to the coupled UCLALES-SALSA have been designed and developed by the Finnish Meteorological Institute.
The master branch of UCLALES-SALSA now contains all the updates included in the UCLALES-SALSA DEV v2.0.2 plus an improved forc.f90 function to account for wetted aerosol seeding during the simulation.
The cloud scheme in UCLALES-SALSA is shown in https://github.com/UCLALES-SALSA/UCLALES-SALSA/releases/tag/v2.1 
** Installation: To install this model, simply type
  git clone https://github.com/UCLALES-SALSA/UCLALES-SALSA.git
  and run
  make seq
  or
  make mpi
depending if you want a sequential build for single-processor runs or an MPI build for parallel multiprocessor runs. Note that you probably have to adjust the paths to MPI and NetCDF libraries in the makefile found in the model root folder. Makefile_ubuntu and Makefile_CRAY provide examples for a simple ubuntu workstation and a Cray supercomputing cluster. The code compiles correctly at least with GCC. Intel compilers should work, too. After compiling the model, the executable is found in the bin-folder together with the runscript "runles". This should be used for both parallel and sequential runs. You probably need to adjust the generation of the file job.sh at the end of the script according to the specifics of your local batch system. The bin folder contains all the necessary files to perform a testrun.
